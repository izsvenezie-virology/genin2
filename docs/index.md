Genin2 is a lightining-fast bioinformatic tool to predict genotypes for clade 2.3.4.4b H5Nx viruses collected in Europe since October 2020. Genotypes are assigned using the methods described in [this article](https://doi.org/10.1093/ve/veae027). Genin2 identifies only epidemiologically relevant European genotypes, i.e., detected in at least 3 viruses collected from at least 2 countries. You can inspect the up-to-date list of supported genotypes in [this file](https://github.com/izsvenezie-virology/genin2/blob/master/src/genin2/compositions.tsv).

Note that, as of version 2.1.0, Genin2 is also cabable of distinguishing the `DI`, `DI.1`, and `DI.2` subgenotypes.

## Features

- :penguin: **Cross-platform**: Genin2 can be run on any platform that supports the Python interpreter. Including, but not limited to: Windows, Linux, MacOS.
- :balloon: **Extremely lightweight**: the prediction models weight less than 1 MB
- :cherry_blossom: **Easy on the resources**: genin2 can be run on any laptop; 1 CPU and 200 MB of RAM is all it takes
- :zap: **Lightning-fast**: on a single 2.30 GHz core, Genin2 can process more than 1'200 sequences per minute
